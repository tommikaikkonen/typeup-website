## How It Works

Set a font size and line length [plus any of the numerous settings]. TypeUp turns those into a set of CSS rules for vertical rhythm in *pixel snapped* `em`s.

## Features

* Great defaults
* Easy to use
* Configurable
* Perfect for responsive web design
* Modular Scale for font sizing

## Baseline

TypeUp calculates a good baseline for your typography based on line length. Roll with the great defaults or fine tune them with precision.

## Extend

TypeUp sets type for common elements (`h[1-6]`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `pre`, `blockquote`), but with the same mixins TypeUp uses internally you can set your type to any element, fast.

## Prototype

Design in the browser with speed. You'll have tried 5 different typographic designs before you can set the proper adjustment in Photoshop for one.

## Modular Scale

TypeUp depends on the [Modular Scale](#) gem for font sizing, which delivers beautiful heading hierarchies. Customize the scale ratio as you want - TypeUp makes sure each heading has proper spacing.
