			# Hello Bandit
			
			I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Tell him time is of the essence.
			
			## See-Through

			I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I have a dark side, too.

			* Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.
			* Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

			### Let's Give the Boy a Hand
			
			Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.
			
			Watching ice melt. This is fun. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Pretend.
